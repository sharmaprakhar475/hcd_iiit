                                                            address this problem, we build an interactive smartphone-based educational mobile
                                                            application using the user-centered design process. This application teaches English
                                                            intonations based on globally consistent pitch patterns through conversations with a

                                                            visual designers, we assess its effectiveness by measuring the pre and

                                                            tremendous potential to enable compelling applications in a multitude of domains
                                                            ranging from healthcare and education to interactive systems. Traditional,
                                                            vision-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods, however, are vulnerable to
                                                            external factors like occlusion and lighting, while also raising privacy concerns
                                                            coupled with the impractical requirement of positioning the camera in front of the
                                                            user at all times. To bridge this gap, we propose ExpressEar, a novel FER system that
                                                            repurposes commercial earables augmented with inertial sensors to capture
                                                            fine-grained facial muscle movements. Following the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which encodes every possible expression in terms of constituent facial
                                                            movements called Action Units (AUs), ExpressEar identifies facial expressions at the
                                                            atomic level. We conducted a user study (N=12) to evaluate the performance of our
                                                            approach and found that ExpressEar can detect and distinguish between 32 Facial AUs
                                                            (including 2 variants of asymmetric AUs), with an average accuracy of 89.9% for any
                                                            given user. We further quantify the performance across different mobile scenarios in

                                                        for output based on how they are connected to the human body. In this work, we
                                                        investigate the idea of delivering notifications through devices worn on the underside
                                                        of a user’s clothing. A wearable worn in such a manner is in direct contact with the
                                                        user’s skin. We leverage this proximity to test the performance of 10 on-skin
                                                        sensations (Press, Poke, Pinch, Heat, Cool, Blow, Suck, Vibrate, Moisture and Brush) as

                                                        prevent the spread of Covid-19. This led to the shutdown of educational institutes
                                                        throughout the country, restricting all activities to online mediums. The shift has
                                                        affected how students engage with each other, where rather than in-person
                                                        interaction, they meet through a variety of online tools. In this paper, we discuss how
                                                        the normal everyday routine of ‘hanging out’ with friends has been transformed
                                                        during a prolonged lockdown of over ten months and counting. We investigate the
                                                        opportunities and challenges students encounter when socializing online through
                                                        various online modes including video calls, communal movie watching and social
                                                        media. We discuss how social interaction; in particular, hanging out with friends has
                                                        been transformed through these technologies and its implications for facilitating
                                                        spontaneous interaction, negotiating intimacy, mutual understanding, and
                                                        accessibility to different social groups. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how
                                                        these factors impact the transition from in-person to online modes of casual social

                                                        interpersonal relationships are nowhere yet everywhere. However, opportunities for
                                                        initiating or maintaining friendships and romance in the physical world have
                                                        dwindled. Within the context of India where multiple realities exist, the question
                                                        arises – what is the future of these relationships? In this paper, we present the
                                                        outcomes of a workshop looking at the future of relationships using design fiction.
                                                        Participants worked in small teams to create scenarios that critically consider the
                                                        future of love, friendships, and romance within the Indian context. Through the lenses
                                                        of criticality, empowerment, and value creation, we examine the design scenarios and
                                                        the design process including criticality of the designs, empowering experiences of the
                                                        participants, and the perceived value gained from participating in such a workshop. Our findings indicate the potential of design fiction to allow participants to step out of
                                                        their comfort zone into a critical stance in discussing love and intimacy. Based upon
                                                        our findings, we discuss implications for design research, practice, and education.</p>

                                                        experiences of the participants and moderators. The goal is to contribute to the

                                                        challenges and opportunities towards realizing this vision. Working in small teams,
                                                        participants will collaboratively conceptually design a future scenario for AIAI or
                                                        critically analyse an example solution. The aim is for teams to tackle tough questions
                                                        related to what it means for AI to be accessible and inclusive, while addressing

                                                        them in the future. Finally, teams will present their conceptual designs and scenarios
                                                        in the larger group. Overall, the workshop will ignite innovative, and even provocative,

                                                        smartphone apps. To address this, we conduct a case study of a popular board game,
                                                        Ludo, to understand players’ opinions of its digital adaptation. For this, we study the

                                                        tremendous potential to enable compelling applications in a multitude of domains
                                                        ranging from healthcare and education to interactive systems. Traditional,
                                                        vision-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods, however, are vulnerable to
                                                        external factors like occlusion and lighting, while also raising privacy concerns
                                                        coupled with the impractical requirement of positioning the camera in front of the
                                                        user at all times. To bridge this gap, we propose ExpressEar, a novel FER system that
                                                        repurposes commercial earables augmented with inertial sensors to capture
                                                        fine-grained facial muscle movements. Following the Facial Action Coding System
                                                        (FACS), which encodes every possible expression in terms of constituent facial
                                                        movements called Action Units (AUs), ExpressEar identifies facial expressions at the atomic level. We conducted a user study (N=12) to evaluate the performance of our
                                                        approach and found that ExpressEar can detect and distinguish between 32 Facial
                                                        AUs (including 2 variants of asymmetric AUs), with an average accuracy of 89.9% for
                                                        any given user. We further quantify the performance across different mobile
                                                        scenarios in presence of additional face-related activities. Our results demonstrate
                                                        ExpressEar's applicability in the real world and open up research opportunities to

                                                        customers to solve different queries in a wide range of domain areas. During social
                                                        interaction, politeness plays a vital role in achieving effective communication.
                                                        Consequently, it becomes essential to understand how a chatbot’s politeness affects
                                                        user experience during the interaction. To understand it, we conducted a

                                                        actively-researched task. While many studies have used different approaches for
                                                        backchannel prediction, they all have depended on manual annotations for a large

                                                        backchannels, thereby easing the annotation process. To analyze our identification
                                                        module’s feasibility, we compared the backchannel prediction models trained on (a)

                                                        found the backchannel responses predicted by the proposed model more natural.

                                                        actionable guidelines for designing smartphone UIs that would be usable by
                                                        low-literate users. We reviewed the last two decades of HCI literature engaging
                                                        people with low literacy, to synthesize our framework—designing SARAL. To
                                                        evaluate the framework, we conducted a preliminary study with a group of 20
                                                        practitioners and researchers working in the field of UI/UX/HCI. We also analyzed six
                                                        publicly available industry reports on designing UIs for people with low-literacy. The
                                                        proposed guidelines intend to support researchers, practitioners, designers, and
                                                        implementers in the design and evaluation of UIs of smartphone applications for
                                                        people with low literacy. We present the evolutionary nature of the proposed

                                                        play a vital role in public healthcare. CHWs particularly assist in improving maternal
                                                        and child health conditions of the poor and vulnerable who often remain unaware of
                                                        the available services and face socio-cultural barriers in accessing the health
                                                        services. India, which is still undergoing a burden of high child mortality, implements
                                                        its CHW program as a flagship program with close to a million CHWs appointed
                                                        across its states. However, under-training significantly limits the ability of CHWs to
                                                        provide quality services. We address the training problem in India by designing and
                                                        deploying low-cost mobile training tools that can complement the existing
                                                        face-to-face training mechanisms. Our system adopts a hybrid architecture to use
                                                        Interactive Voice Response for facilitating online audio training sessions. Thus,
                                                        allowing CHWs to access training from anywhere through their feature phones, a key

                                                        potential for peer-to-peer learning models to address the challenge of experts
                                                        availability through a controlled field experiment, and (4) Finally, exploring the
                                                        potential for automated techniques in this domain by proposing a semi-automated

                                                        Despite such wide usage, the AI based testing literature of these ‘intelligent’ models
                                                        is highly lacking. Most of the papers proposing new models rely only on qudratic
                                                        weighted kappa (QWK) based agreement with human raters for showing model
                                                        efficacy. However, this effectively ignores the highly multi-feature nature of essay
                                                        scoring. Essay scoring depends on features like coherence, grammar, relevance,
                                                        sufficiency, vocabulary, etc., and till date, there has been no study testing Automated
                                                        Essay Scoring (AES) systems holistically on all these features. With this motivation,
                                                        we propose a model agnostic adversarial evaluation scheme and associated metrics
                                                        for AES systems to test their natural language understanding capabilities and
                                                        overall robustness. We evaluate the current state-of-the-art AES models using the
                                                        proposed scheme and report the results on five recent models. These models range
                                                        from feature-engineering based approaches to the latest deep learning algorithms.
                                                        We find that AES models are highly overstable such that even heavy modifications
                                                        (as much as 25%) with content unrelated to the topic of the questions does not
                                                        decrease the score produced by the models. On the other hand, unrelated content,
                                                        on average, increases the scores, thus showing that the models’ evaluation strategy
                                                        and rubrics should be reconsidered. We also ask 200 human raters to score both an
                                                        original and adversarial response to see if humans are able to detect differences
                                                        between the two and whether they agree with the scores assigned by autoscorers.</p>

                                                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Deep-learning based Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) systems are being
                                                        actively used by states and language testing agencies alike to evaluate millions of
                                                        candidates for life-changing decisions ranging from college applications to visa approvals. However, little research has been put to understand and interpret the
                                                        black-box nature of deep-learning based scoring algorithms. Previous studies
                                                        indicate that scoring models can be easily fooled. In this paper, we explore the
                                                        reason behind their surprising adversarial brittleness. We utilize recent advances in
                                                        interpretability to find the extent to which features such as coherence, content,
                                                        vocabulary, and relevance are important for automated scoring mechanisms. We
                                                        use this to investigate the oversensitivity (i.e., large change in output score with a
                                                        little change in input essay content) and overstability (i.e., little change in output
                                                        scores with large changes in input essay content) of AES. Our results indicate that
                                                        autoscoring models, despite getting trained as “end-to-end” models with rich
                                                        contextual embeddings such as BERT, behave like bag-of-words models. A few
                                                        words determine the essay score without the requirement of any context making
                                                        the model largely overstable. This is in stark contrast to recent probing studies on
                                                        pre-trained representation learning models, which show that rich linguistic features
                                                        such as parts-of-speech and morphology are encoded by them. Further, we also find
                                                        that the models have learnt dataset biases, making them oversensitive. The
                                                        presence of a few words with high co-occurence with a certain score class makes
                                                        the model associate the essay sample with that score. This causes score changes in
                                                        ∼95% of samples with an addition of only a few words. To deal with these issues, we
                                                        propose detection-based protection models that can detect oversensitivity and
                                                        overstability causing samples with high accuracies. We find that our proposed
                                                        models are able to detect unusual attribution patterns and flag adversarial samples

                                                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Automatic Speech Scoring (ASS) is the computer-assisted evaluation of a
                                                        candidate’s speaking proficiency in a language. ASS systems face many challenges
                                                        like open grammar, variable pronunciations, and unstructured or semi-structured
                                                        content. Recent deep learning approaches have shown some promise in this
                                                        domain. However, most of these approaches focus on extracting features from a
                                                        single audio, making them suffer from the lack of speaker-specific context required
                                                        to model such a complex task. We propose a novel deep learning technique for
                                                        non-native ASS, called speaker-conditioned hierarchical modeling. In our technique,
                                                        we take advantage of the fact that oral proficiency tests rate multiple responses for
                                                        a candidate. We extract context vectors from these responses and feed them as
                                                        additional speaker-specific context to our network to score a particular response.
                                                        We compare our technique with strong baselines and find that such modeling
                                                        improves the model’s average performance by 6.92% (maximum = 12.86%,
                                                        minimum = 4.51%). We further show both quantitative and qualitative insights into
                                                        the importance of this additional context in solving the problem of ASS.</p>

                                                        Such temporal streams of information show power-law dynamics, scale-free

                                                        nature. Existing research focuses on the textual elements of financial disclosures
                                                        like earnings calls transcripts to forecast stock volatility and risk, but ignores the

                                                        approaches that leverage the verbal and vocal cues of speakers in financial

                                                        realm is still plagued with a severe underrepresentation of various communities

                                                        models are better risk forecasters, it is imperative to also investigate the potential

                                                        volatility prediction due to gender sensitive audio features and fewer female
                                                        executives in earnings calls of one of the world’s biggest stock indexes, the S&P 500
                                                        index. We quantitatively analyze bias as error disparity and investigate the sources
                                                        of this bias. Our results suggest that multimodal neural financial models accentuate

                                                        over several facets of sexual harassment in our society. Prior work by the NLP
                                                        community for automated identification of the narratives related to sexual abuse
                                                        disclosures barely explored this social phenomenon as an independent task.
                                                        However, emotional attributes associated with textual conversations related to the

                                                        formulate the task of identifying narratives related to the sexual abuse disclosures
                                                        in online posts as a joint modeling task that leverages their emotional attributes
                                                        through multitask learning. Our results demonstrate that positive knowledge

                                                        to the public. These efforts primarily rely on self-reports of potential self-harm
                                                        content that is reviewed by moderators. Most recently, platforms have employed

                                                        automated models still struggle to understand the nuance of human language (e.g.,
                                                        sarcasm). By explicitly focusing on Twitter posts that could easily be misidentified
                                                        by a model as expressing suicidal intent (i.e., they contain similar phrases such as
                                                        ``wanting to die''), our work examines the temporal differences in historical

                                                        suicidal intent. Additionally, we analyze time-aware neural models that build on

                                                        years. Joint audio-visual analysis can improve the event detection accuracy but may
                                                        not always be feasible as under many circumstances only audio recordings are
                                                        available in real-world scenarios. To solve the challenges, we present a novel

                                                        detection from audio recordings. Our model adopts a multimodal teacher network
                                                        based on both acoustic and visual clues, and a single-modal student network based
                                                        on acoustic clues only. Conventional teacher-student learning performs
                                                        unsatisfactorily for knowledge transfer from a multi-modality network to a

                                                        research and subsumes many tasks. Predicting listener backchannels is one such
                                                        actively-researched task. While many studies have used different approaches for
                                                        backchannel prediction, they all have depended on manual annotations for a large
                                                        dataset. This is a bottleneck impacting the scalability of development. To this end,
                                                        we propose using semi-supervised techniques to automate the process of
                                                        identifying backchannels, thereby easing the annotation process. To analyze our
                                                        identification module’s feasibility, we compared the backchannel prediction models
                                                        trained on (a) manually-annotated and (b) semi-supervised labels. Quantitative
                                                        analysis revealed that the proposed semi-supervised approach could attain 95% of
                                                        the former’s performance. Our user-study fndings revealed that almost 60% of the
                                                        participants found the backchannel responses predicted by the proposed model
                                                        more natural. Finally, we also analyzed the impact of personality on the type of
                                                        backchannel signals and validated our fndings in the user-study.</p>

                                                        Despite advances in stock forecasting, a limitation of most existing neural methods
                                                        is that they treat stocks independent of each other, ignoring the valuable rich signals
                                                        between related stocks’ movements. Motivated by financial literature that shows
                                                        stock markets and inter-stock correlations show scale-free network characteristics,
                                                        we leverage domain knowledge on the Web to model inter-stock relations as a
                                                        graph in four major global stock markets and formulate stock selection as a

                                                        and temporal dependencies in stock prices, we propose HyperStockGAT: Hyperbolic

                                                        stock selection. Our work’s key novelty is the proposal of modeling the complex,
                                                        scale-free nature of inter-stock relations through temporal hyperbolic graph

                                                        between stocks more accurately. Through extensive experiments on long-term
                                                        real-world data spanning over six years on four of the world’s biggest markets:

                                                        significantly outperforms state-of-the-art stock forecasting methods in terms of
                                                        profitability by over 12%, and risk-adjusted Sharpe Ratio by over 4%. We analyze

                                                        methods for assessing suicide risk on social media have shown promise, a crippling
                                                        limitation of existing solutions is that they ignore the inherent ordinal nature across
                                                        finegrain levels of suicide risk. To this end, we reformulate suicide risk assessment
                                                        as an Ordinal Regression problem, over the ColumbiaSuicide Severity Scale. We

                                                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Code-switching is the communication phenomenon where speakers
                                                        switch between different languages during a conversation. With the widespread
                                                        adoption of conversational agents and chat platforms, code-switching has become
                                                        an integral part of written conversations in many multi-lingual communities
                                                        worldwide. This makes it essential to develop techniques for summarizing and
                                                        understanding these conversations. Towards this objective, we introduce
                                                        abstractive summarization of Hindi-English code-switched conversations and

                                                        which contains over 6,831 conversations in Hindi-English and their corresponding

                                                        yet understand the inherent robustness achieved by contributions from different
                                                        layers of a PLM. We systematically analyze the robustness of these representations
                                                        layer by layer from two perspectives. First, we measure the robustness of
                                                        representations by using domain divergence between two domains. We find that i)
                                                        Domain variance increases from the lower to the upper layers for vanilla PLMs; ii)

                                                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> GPS coordinates are fine-grained location indicators that are difficult to
                                                        be effectively utilized by classifiers in geo-aware applications. Previous GPS
                                                        encoding methods concentrate on generating hand-crafted features for small areas
                                                        of interest. However, many real world applications require a machine learning
                                                        model, analogous to the pre-trained ImageNet model for images, that can efficiently
                                                        generate semantically-enriched features for planet-scale GPS coordinates. To
                                                        address this issue, we propose a novel two-level grid-based framework, termed
                                                        GPS2Vec, which is able to extract geo-aware features in real-time for locations
                                                        worldwide. The Earth's surface is first discretized by the Universal Transverse
                                                        Mercator (UTM) coordinate system. Each UTM zone is then considered as a local
                                                        area of interest that is further divided into fine-grained cells to perform the initial
                                                        GPS encoding. We train a neural network in each UTM zone to learn the semantic
                                                        embeddings from the initial GPS encoding. The training labels can be automatically
                                                        derived from large-scale geotagged documents such as tweets, check-ins, and
                                                        images that are available from social sharing platforms. We conducted
                                                        comprehensive experiments on three geo-aware applications, namely place

                                                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Visual Question Generation (VQG) is the task of generating natural
                                                        questions based on an image. Popular methods in the past have explored
                                                        image-to-sequence architectures trained with maximum likelihood which have
                                                        demonstrated meaningful generated questions given an image and its associated
                                                        ground-truth answer. VQG becomes more challenging if the image contains rich
                                                        contextual information describing its different semantic categories. In this paper,
                                                        we try to exploit the different visual cues and concepts in an image to generate
                                                        questions using a variational autoencoder (VAE) without ground-truth answers.
                                                        Our approach solves two major shortcomings of existing VQG systems: (i) minimize
                                                        the level of supervision and (ii) replace generic questions with category relevant
                                                        generations. Most importantly, by eliminating expensive answer annotations, the
                                                        required supervision is weakened. Using different categories enables us to exploit
                                                        different concepts as the inference requires only the image and the category. Mutual
                                                        information is maximized between the image, question, and answer category in the
                                                        latent space of our VAE. A novel category consistent cyclic loss is proposed to enable
                                                        the model to generate consistent predictions with respect to the answer category, reducing redundancies and irregularities. Additionally, we also impose
                                                        supplementary constraints on the latent space of our generative model to provide
                                                        structure based on categories and enhance generalization by encapsulating
                                                        decorrelated features within each dimension. Through extensive experiments, the
